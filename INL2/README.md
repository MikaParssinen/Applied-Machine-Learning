# Assignment 2: Problem Solving with Unsupervised Learning

### Overview

The assignment assesses your understanding of applying and evaluating the performance of unsupervised machine learning algorithms. For this task, we will use the **Market Segmentation dataset** to develop unsupervised learning models that offer recommendations such as saving plans, loans, and wealth management options for targeted customer groups.

### Data Description

In marketing, **market segmentation** divides a broad consumer or business market, typically consisting of current and potential customers, into subgroups based on shared characteristics. This dataset provides insights into the behavior of approximately **9,000 active credit cardholders** over the past six months, summarized at the customer level with **18 behavioral variables**.

### Your Task

1. **Define the Problem**  
   Describe how the model can offer recommendations, such as saving plans, loans, and wealth management, for specific customer groups.

2. **Develop Recommendation Models**  
   Use unsupervised learning algorithms to create models that recommend financial products to different customer segments. Focus on clustering algorithms, specifically:
   - **Hierarchical Clustering**
   - **DBSCAN**  
     We may also use other algorithms, such as k-means, although this is optional.

3. **Evaluate Model Performance**  
   Assess the effectiveness of each model.

4. **Submit Code and Report**  
   Provide both our code and a concise report detailing your findings.

**Note**: For data visualization, you can use **PCA** and **t-SNE** to display cluster data.

### Report Instructions

The report should be a maximum of **4 pages** and cover the following:

- **Problem Formulation**  
  Briefly describe the problem and how unsupervised learning addresses it.

- **Data Sampling**  
  Explain how we sampled your training and test datasets.

- **Hyperparameter Values**  
  List the hyperparameters for each algorithm and explain our choices.

- **Model Selection Method**  
  Describe the model selection method used (e.g., cross-validation or hold-out) and why it was chosen.

- **Evaluation Metrics**  
  Specify the evaluation metrics used to compare models and explain why they were selected.

- **Summary of Results**  
  Present our results with tables and graphs to highlight key findings.

- **Performance Discussion**  
  Discuss the performance of the algorithms, including limitations, impact of hyperparameter values, etc.

**File Naming Convention**: Save both the code and report as `DVA263_INL2_Group_Id`.
