\section{Conclusion}

For the purpose of segmenting the dataset of credit card holders, hierarchical clustering can be used to divide the data into distinct clusters. DBSCAN was shown to not segment this dataset very well and the clusters created could not provide any useful information.
\par
The clusters created by hierarchical clustering are distinct enough that they can be used by the credit card company to provide tailored services to their customers. The company could offer premium plans to the customers segmented into a cluster with high spending habits, offer saving plans to customers that owes a lot of money and create insentives for low spenders to start spending more money.
