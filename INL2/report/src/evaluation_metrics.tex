\section{Metrics used for evaulation}

The evaulation metrics we use for meauring how well defined our clusters are, are Silhouette Score and Dunn Index. The Silhouette Score is a measure of how similar a data point is to its own cluster compared to other clusters. The score ranges from $-1$ to $1$, where a high value indicates that the data point is well matched to its own cluster and poorly matched to neighboring clusters.

The Dunn Index is a measure of how compact the clusters are and how well separated they are from each other. The index ranges from $0$ to infinity, where a high value indicates that the clusters are compact and well separated.
