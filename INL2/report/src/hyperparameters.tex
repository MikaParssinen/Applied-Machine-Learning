\section{Hyperparameter selection}

\subsection{Hierarchical clustering}

The chosen hyperparameters for the Hierarchical clustering model are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Method = Ward:} Because our data is numerical, and we want compact clusters the method choice is straight forward. Ward's method minimizes the total within cluster variance which results in compact and homogeneous clusters.
    
    \item \textbf{Metric = Euclidean:} Ward's method requires the use of the distance function Euclidean, when comparing alternative methods (average, complete, etc) with other distance functions we do not observe similarly effective cluster separations. Therefore strengthening our choice of Ward's method and Euclidean distance.
\end{itemize}
