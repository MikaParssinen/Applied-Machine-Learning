\section{Sampling data}

Before we start the clustering process, we need to do some preprocessing of our data. The ``CUST\_ID'' column is just an identifier for that unique customer, therefore it is not part of our feature vector and we remove it from our dataset. 
\par
The ``TENURE'' column describes the time, in months, the customer has been a credit card holder. We deem that since the the data is collected during a limited time, this feature says very little about the customer and will create noise in our data.
\par
The dataset also has missing values in some of the cells. The amount of rows that has a column with missing values is $< 5\%$ so we deem it acceptable to remove these rows.
