\section{Sampling data}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Remove ``customer ID'' column from the dataset since it is not just an identifier for that unique feature vector.
    \item Remove ``tenure'' column from the dataset since we deem it might create noise in our data because the data is collected during a limited time.
    \item Remove the rows with missing values from the dataset.
\end{itemize}
