\subsection{Image Classification}

After identifying an image as an anomaly, our methods will also classify the reason for the anomaly. For the task of multi-class image classification we use a convolutional neural network (CNN). CNN's use convolutional and maxpooling layers to extract important features from each class of training image to allow for predictions on unseen images.
