\subsection{Related Work}

In ``Deep Industrial Image Anomaly Detection: A Survey'', Liu et al. cover a wide variety of methods for image anomaly detection. They categories the methods into being either feature-embedding or reconstruction-based. They cover both supervised and unsupervised learning methods as well as discussing current limitations in both public datasets and collecting data from industrial environments.

Wang et al. \cite{wang2018defect} propose a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based approach for defect detection, demonstrating its effectiveness in industrial applications. 
Their method leverages deep feature extraction to identify anomalies with high accuracy. 
By using CNNs, they improve upon traditional handcrafted feature-based techniques, enabling automated and scalable defect detection in manufacturing environments.
