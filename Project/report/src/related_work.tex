\subsection{Related Work}

In ``Deep Industrial Image Anomaly Detection: A Survey'', Liu et al. cover a wide variety of methods for image anomaly detection. They categories the methods into being either feature-embedding or reconstruction-based. They cover both supervised and unsupervised learning methods as well as discussing current limitations in both public datasets and collecting data from industrial environments.
