\subsection{Anomaly Detection}

With the introduction of Industry $4.0$, the manufacturing industry have been going through rapid developments in digital technologies \cite{industry4}. The technologies include big data analysis, machine learning and artificial intelligence. With more and more data available, various methods can be used to understand production processes.

One use case for analyzing this data is to study irregularities and disturbances in a production line. These irregularities and disturbances are what is commonly called anomalies \cite{AnomalyDef}. A more general definition is ``deviation from the common rule'', but can be further specified according to context \cite{dictionary}. For the purpose of this study, we will define anomalies as damage and contamination of the end product. Different anomalies can educate manufacturers of irregularities and disturbances that may be occuring in the production line.
