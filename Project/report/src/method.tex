\section{Method}

To solve the problem of anomaly detection and image classification, a machine learning pipeline has been developed. The pipeline consists of a anomaly detection procedure that use an autoencoder to reconstruct an input image, calculate the reconstruction error and make a decision based on the error. Images that the anomaly detection procedure considers as anomalies are then passed to a CNN to classify the anomaly. The pipeline is visualized in figure \ref{fig:ml_pipeline}.
