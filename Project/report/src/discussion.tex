\section{Discussion}

\subsection{Ethical consideration}

Our implementation of a machine learning model to classify bottles in a factory brings a few important ethical considerations. 
While the technology offers great improvements in quality control and efficiency, it also presents challenges that need to be discussed and thought about.

First of is data security and privacy. 
The system processes large amounts of production data that could be valuable to competitors. 
Factories that uses our implementation is therefore recommended to implement a robust cybersecurity system to protect against industrial espionage and unauthorized access. 
This includes secure data storage, encrypted communications, and strict access controls for system modifications.

Additionally, our implementation leads to workforce changes. While some traditional quality control positions may be displaced, new roles emerge in system maintenance, monitoring, and data analysis. 
This transformation requires human resources, they should present retraining programs and use clear communication with affected employees.
To ensure employees gets the right and fair treatment.

Finally, accountability and responsibility of our implementation present another critical consideration. 
If defective products reach customers, clear frameworks must be establish whether responsibility lies with the system developers, factory management, or quality control staff. 
This requires transparent documentation of the system's decision-making process and regular reviews of its performance.

In conclusion, ethical implications of implementing this technology extend beyond the factory product line.
While automation can improve product quality and reduce waste, organizations must balance these benefits against their social responsibilities. 
This includes maintaining employment opportunities while adapting to technological advancement, ensuring transparent communication with stakeholders, and maintaining human oversight in critical decision-making processes.

• Inte riktig data
• Fake noise, riktigt noise skulle vara damm och smuts på linsen tex.
