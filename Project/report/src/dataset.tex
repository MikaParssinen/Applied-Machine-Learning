\subsection{Dataset}

To train machine learning models and to make predictions on unseen data, our paper uses the MVTec AD dataset \cite{mvtec-dataset}. This dataset consists of a variety of manufacturing errors among a collection of different products. The proposed methods in this paper are tested on the glass bottle images of this dataset. The glass bottle directory in the complete dataset contains labeled images in the categories, ``good'', ``broken\_small'', ``broken\_large'' and ``contamination''. Example of good images and a broken images can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:dataset_example} below.
