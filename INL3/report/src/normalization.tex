\section{Normalization and outlier removal}

As part of the assignment, each pixel value has to be scaled down to the range $[0, 1]$. This is done by dividing each pixel value by $255.0$. This is done to feed our models with values that are they expect, the neurons in the networks except values in the range $[0, 1]$. The original pixel values are also in discrete integer values and the neural networks are work with continuous values.

In terms of outliers, all appropiate preprocessing has been done and each image is considered to be equally important for classification. For this reason, no image is considered an outlier and no images are removed from the dataset.
