\section{Problem formulation}

In assignment INL3, we are tasked with what is considered the ``Hello World'' of computer vision. Our task is to use the MNIST handwritten digits database to develop neural networks and deep learning models for image classification. 
\par
The dataset consists of $60,000$ training images and $10,000$ test images of handwritten digits. Each image is $28 \times 28$ pixels, and each pixel contains a value between $0$ and $255$ representing the gray-scale intensity of the pixel. $0$ means all black and $255$ means all white. To train a CNN-model and a ANN-model, we have been provided with Jupyter Notebook templates for each model. 
\par
We are tasked with doing feature extraction from these images, build network architectures suitable for this dataset, train these models, and evaluate the performance of the models.
