\section{Hyperparameter selection}
\subsection{Support vector machine (SVM)}

An SVM has several hyperparameters, but two of the most important are the Regularization Parameter 
(\(C\)) and the choice of Kernel. Depending on the kernel function used, other hyperparameters, such as Gamma
(\(\gamma\)) and Degree, may also need to be tuned. Values chosen:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{\(\boldsymbol{C}\)}:
    \item \textbf{Kernel}:
\end{itemize}
