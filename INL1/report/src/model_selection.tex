\section{Model selection}
Cross-validation is an effective method for model selection because it ensures that each model is tested on every data point, allowing for a fair comparison between models and ensuring model robustness.
This process not only helps in selecting the best-performing model but also plays a crucial role in hyperparameter tuning. 
When combined with grid search, cross-validation helps identify the optimal hyperparameter values by evaluating each combination, leading to improved model performance.
Therefore, we have chosen Cross-validation as our method to select the best model.
