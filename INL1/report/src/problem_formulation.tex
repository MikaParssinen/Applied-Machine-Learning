\section{Problem formulation}

To get the most use of a football player, it is best to put them in a position where their specific set of skills shine. In our assignment we will try to predict what preferred position a football players has, based on their attributes. We will limit the classification problem to just outfield players, to classify a goalkeeper would be trivial. To achieve this we will use the given dataset, FIFA 18 Players database. The dataset has preferred positions labeled as a non-empty set of possible positions. Our problem will try and guess one of these positions.
