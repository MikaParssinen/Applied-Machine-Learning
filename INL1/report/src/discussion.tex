\section{Discussion}

NOTES:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The results show that the pattern in the feature vectors for the different positions aren't distinct enough to create a predictive model that can accurately predict the position of a player.
    \item Synthetic data, the data is based on a mix of opinions and real-world data. There is no concrete way to measure the dribbling skills of a football player. Also with game balancing.
    \item Missing data, if a player is left-footed or right-footed would play a significant role of which side of the field the player prefers to play on.
