\section{Metrics used for evaulation}

The evaluation metrics used for classification is quite straight forward, we will measure accuracy in terms of how many predicted labels are correct over the total amount of test labels. What we do do different from a standard labeling procedure is what we consider is labeling test data correctly. The regular labeling process consider a prediction correct if the predicted label is an exact match with the test label. But what we consider an accurate prediction is if the label is a subset of the set of possible positions for the player.
