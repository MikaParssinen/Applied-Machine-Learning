\section{Conclusion}
SVM achieved the best accuracy but had the longest runtime. RF also performed well, though our computational resources may have been a bottleneck, preventing it from reaching its full potential.
Additionally, the dataset is synthetic, lacks important features (such as players' weak and strong foot), and only includes male football players. 
Therefore, one could argue that the problem statement should be revised to 'Predicting the position of a male FIFA football player.'
