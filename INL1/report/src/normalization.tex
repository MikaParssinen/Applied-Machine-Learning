\section{Normalization}

To get better accuracy in our classifiers, normalization is sometimes needed. This section explains the choice of normalizing or not for each model. We also explain which normalization technique we use for the models that we do normalize.

\subsection{Support vector machine (SVM)}

\subsection{Naive bayes classifiers}

The naive bayes classifiers assume that each feature is indebendent of eachother. This means that the model will work best with the data not being normalized. We would gain no more information by normalizing the data and a consequence of normalizing could be that we lose information.

\subsection{Random forest}
