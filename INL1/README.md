### Assignment Overview

The assignment covers the assessment of understanding different aspects of applying and evaluating the performances of supervised machine learning algorithms.

You are going to use the FIFA 18 players database in this assignment to develop your machine-learning models using **Naive Bayes Classifiers**, **Random Forest**, and **Support Vector Machines** algorithms.

### Data Description

The database contains players featured in FIFA 18, with more than 17,000 players listed. Each player has 70+ attributes, including Player and Flag Images, Playing Position Data, and Attributes based on actual data from the latest EA's FIFA 18 game. Attributes include all player-style statistics like **Dribbling**, **Aggression**, **GK Skills**, etc. Additionally, it includes player personal data like **Nationality**, **Photo**, **Club**, **Age**, **Wage**, **Salary**, etc.

In addition to these three algorithms, you may also develop models using other algorithms, such as **Decision Tree** and **k-NN**, though this is not mandatory.

### Our Task

1. Define what problem we are going to solve with the dataset.
2. Build machine learning models using the suggested algorithms.
3. Evaluate the performances of the models.
4. Submit our code and a report.

### Report Instructions

- The report should be a maximum of **4 pages**.
- Write briefly about the implementation approach, including:

  - **Problem formulation**.
  - How we sample our training and test dataset.
  - The values of the hyperparameters of each algorithm and our reasons for choosing these values.
  - Which model selection method we used (such as cross-validation or hold-out) and why.
  - The evaluation metrics used for comparison and why we choosed them.
  - A summary of the results, presented using **tables and graphs**.
  - Discussion on the performances of the algorithms, including limitations of our approach, performance related to chosen hyperparameters, etc.

### Submission

**Note**: The file name for both the code and report should be `DVA263_INL1_Group_Id`.
